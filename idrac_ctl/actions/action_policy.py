"""Destructiveness policy for Redfish actions.

The single source of truth for how risky each Redfish action is, keyed by its
full ``#Type.Action`` name. ``invoke_action`` (idrac_manager.py) consults this to
decide whether an action runs freely, runs with a one-line notice, defaults to a
dry-run unless ``--confirm`` is given, or additionally needs an explicit
"I understand this is irreversible" token.

Fail-safe by construction: an action not in the table is treated as DESTRUCTIVE,
so a newly exposed (unclassified) action can never POST without an explicit
confirm. This module is product-neutral — it names standard DMTF + NVIDIA OEM
action types only and imports nothing from the iDRAC layer.
