"""Async subnet scan for reachable Redfish services.

:func:`scan_subnet` probes many hosts concurrently for a Redfish service root and
returns the ones that answer. It performs **no** network I/O itself and stores no
credentials: the caller injects an async ``get`` callable that knows how to fetch
``/redfish/v1/`` for a single host (with whatever auth/TLS policy the caller
chose). That keeps this module product-neutral and fully offline-testable — tests
pass a fake async GET.

Concurrency is bounded by an :class:`asyncio.Semaphore` so a large host list
cannot open an unbounded number of sockets at once.
