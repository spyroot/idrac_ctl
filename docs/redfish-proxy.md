# Fleet Redfish Proxy

> Status: design only. The CLI works without this service.

For one server, I use `idrac_ctl` directly. For a fleet, I want one service that can reach the BMC
network, keep desired state, read observed state, and reconcile the two. Clients should not all need
direct routes to BMCs.

## What Exists

The CLI already has the pieces I would reuse:

- `RedfishManager`, defined in `idrac_ctl/redfish_manager.py`, for product-neutral HTTP.
- `IDracManager`, defined in `idrac_ctl/idrac_manager.py`, for Dell/iDRAC behavior and host-system
  selection.
- Vendor-neutral reads such as `sensors`, `network-adapters`, `metric-reports`, `logs`,
  `secure-boot`, and `oem-info`.
- Four offline corpora: Dell, Supermicro GB300, HPE iLO, and generic DMTF Redfish.

What does not exist yet is the controller loop: desired-state storage, drift checks, ordered writes,
job tracking, and fleet-wide backoff.

## Why A Proxy

The main lesson from Ironic and baremetal-operator is simple: isolate the process that can talk to
BMCs. This proxy would keep that process in Python so it can reuse the current Redfish managers and
vendor profiles instead of rebuilding command behavior in another stack.

```text
clients / kubectl / CI
  -> redfish-proxy service
  -> desired + observed state store
  -> async reconcile workers using the current Redfish managers
  -> BMC management network
```

A Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), installed later by an operator, could expose the same
model to cluster users. The first useful version can be smaller: an API, a database, and workers.

## Stored State

Clients write the `spec` fields through the proxy API. The reconcile worker writes the `status`
fields after Redfish reads or confirmed jobs. Field names below are proposed, not implemented.

```yaml
spec:
  bmcAddress: redfish://10.0.0.5/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1
  vendor: dell
  credentialsRef: secret-name
  desired:
    power: "On"
    bootOverride: "Pxe"
    bios: { SriovGlobalEnable: "Enabled" }
status:
  power: "On"
  health: "OK"
  lastReconciled: <timestamp>
  goodCredentials: true
  error: null
```

`credentialsRef` is the name of a Kubernetes Secret created by the installer or operator. That
Secret would hold `username` and `password` keys. The proxy would log only metadata such as whether
credentials worked.

The Dell-shaped `bmcAddress` is only an example. A real proxy needs the same host-system selection
now in `IDracManager`: on a GB300, host actions go to `System_0`, not the HGX baseboard member. On
HPE iLO, the common host and manager ids are `Systems/1` and `Managers/1`.

## Reconcile Rules

Redfish does not give every state change as a push stream. The controller would poll, compare
observed state with `spec.desired`, apply only missing changes, and back off on transient errors.
After a write, it would not claim convergence until the BMC or a Redfish job confirms the new state.

A target profile such as `rt-low-latency` would expand to concrete BIOS attributes and boot settings.
Profiles are easier to review than one-off attribute lists, but the proxy still has to turn them into
ordered Redfish operations. See [BIOS profiles](bios-profiles.md) for the CLI pattern.

`firmware-update` exists as a guarded SimpleUpdate command today. A future proxy would need the same
dry-run/confirm safety model plus stronger rollout controls before running firmware updates at fleet
scale.

## Security

- BMC credentials live in a Kubernetes Secret, referenced by name from `credentialsRef`; they are
  never stored inline in the desired spec and never printed.
- NetworkPolicy, the Kubernetes egress policy installed with the proxy, would restrict traffic to the
  BMC management CIDR.
- TLS verification can stay off on the BMC hop for isolated lab networks, or be enabled with a
  trusted certificate chain.
- RBAC, installed with the proxy service account, would cover only proxy resources and referenced
  Secrets.

## First Useful Version

The first version I would build:

- register a server,
- read observed state,
- set desired power and boot override,
- list servers,
- reconcile one server at a time with SQLite or Postgres.

Bounded concurrency, simulator-backed benchmarks, and 1,000-node gates are separate work; see
[Scaling and benchmarks](scaling-and-benchmarks.md). The current offline and emulator test lanes are
documented in [Testing](testing.md). Vendor maturity is tracked in [Vendors](vendors.md).
