# Command Reference

Author: Mus <spyroot@gmail.com>

When I connect to a new BMC, I run `idrac_ctl system` first. It proves the endpoint, credentials, and
basic Redfish path before I ask for deeper inventory or stage any change.

The table below follows the 92 command names imported by `idrac_ctl/__init__.py`. Run
`idrac_ctl <command> --help` for flags on your installed version.

## Connection Basics

`idrac_main.py` reads these environment variables when you do not pass explicit connection flags:

```bash
export IDRAC_IP=10.0.0.42
export IDRAC_USERNAME=root
export IDRAC_PASSWORD='your-password'
export IDRAC_PORT=443
```

TLS verification is off by default because lab BMCs commonly use self-signed certificates.
`--verify-ssl`, defined by the root parser in `idrac_main.py`, opts into certificate verification
when you have a trusted chain.

## First Reads

```bash
idrac_ctl system
idrac_ctl manager
idrac_ctl chassis
idrac_ctl sensors
idrac_ctl firmware_inventory
idrac_ctl bios --filter ProcCStates,SysMemSize
idrac_ctl logs
idrac_ctl accounts --usernames
idrac_ctl storage-list
idrac_ctl get_vm
```

`system` returns the host ComputerSystem. `manager` returns the BMC manager. `sensors`, defined in
`idrac_ctl/sensors/cmd_sensors.py`, follows Chassis sensor links and returns readings with units.
`logs`, defined in `idrac_ctl/logs/cmd_logs.py`, follows system and manager LogService entries.

## Registered Commands

Safety labels:

- **Read**: expected to read state only.
- **Guarded**: can write, but has a dry-run or confirmation model.
- **Write**: changes BMC or host state; use only on approved targets.

## Vendor-Neutral Telemetry Reads

```bash
idrac_ctl sensors
idrac_ctl metric-definitions
idrac_ctl metric-reports
idrac_ctl telemetry-triggers
idrac_ctl network-adapters
idrac_ctl network-ports
idrac_ctl ethernet-interfaces
idrac_ctl component-integrity
idrac_ctl secure-boot
idrac_ctl logs
idrac_ctl oem-info
```

These commands are the best starting point on non-Dell BMCs. They follow Redfish links and are
covered by the Dell, Supermicro, HPE, or generic fixture corpora listed in [Vendors](vendors.md).

## Mutating Workflow Pattern

Before I run a write, I use the same four phases:

1. Read the current state.
2. Preview the change when the command supports `--show` or `--dry_run`.
3. Execute only with an explicit intent flag such as `--confirm`, `--commit`, or `-r`.
4. Verify with a read-only command or a job/task watch.

### BIOS Change From A Spec

```bash
idrac_ctl bios --filter ProcCStates,SysProfile,WorkloadProfile
idrac_ctl bios-change --from_spec specs/realtime.opt.spec.json on-reset --show
idrac_ctl bios-change --from_spec specs/realtime.opt.spec.json on-reset --commit
idrac_ctl jobs
```

Many BIOS changes remain pending until an apply job and host reset. Add `-r` only when you are ready
for the host reset:

```bash
idrac_ctl bios-change --from_spec specs/realtime.opt.spec.json on-reset -r
```

### Secure Boot

```bash
idrac_ctl secure-boot
idrac_ctl bios-registry --attr_name SecureBoot
idrac_ctl bios-change --attr_name SecureBoot --attr_value Enabled on-reset --show
idrac_ctl bios-change --attr_name SecureBoot --attr_value Enabled on-reset -r
idrac_ctl secure-boot
```

### Virtual Media ISO Boot

```bash
idrac_ctl get_vm
idrac_ctl eject_vm --device_id 1
idrac_ctl insert_vm --uri_path http://10.0.0.10/ubuntu.iso --device_id 1
idrac_ctl get_vm
idrac_ctl boot-one-shot --device Cd -r
idrac_ctl current_boot
```

### Power Reset

```bash
idrac_ctl system
idrac_ctl system-reset --reset_type GracefulRestart --dry_run
idrac_ctl system-reset --reset_type GracefulRestart --confirm
idrac_ctl system
```

`system-reset` previews by default and performs the reset only when `--confirm` is present. The older
`reboot` command is still present for direct reset calls and supports `--wait`, but it does not have
the same dry-run guard.

### Firmware Update

```bash
idrac_ctl firmware_inventory
idrac_ctl firmware-update --image_uri https://example.invalid/firmware.exe --dry_run
idrac_ctl firmware-update --image_uri https://example.invalid/firmware.exe --confirm
idrac_ctl tasks
```

`firmware-update`, defined in `idrac_ctl/firmware/cmd_firmware_update.py`, is destructive when
confirmed. Use only approved images and approved non-production targets until you have your own
firmware rollout process.

### HPE iLO Canary

`examples/hpe_ilo_canary.sh`, the live-emulator script under `examples/`, starts the HPE iLO emulator
and runs read-only vendor-neutral commands plus a dry-run `system-reset` preview:

```bash
bash examples/hpe_ilo_canary.sh
```
