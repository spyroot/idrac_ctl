"""Regression: boot_source_registry must not build a double-slash path.

cmd_boot_source_registry joined ``{idrac_manage_servers}/{BootSourcesRegistryQuery}``,
but BootSourcesRegistryQuery already starts with ``/`` — producing
``/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1//BootSources/BootSourcesRegistry``, which
404s. Found by the Codex worker. The constant is an absolute suffix, so callers
must join WITHOUT an extra slash.
