"""Offline tests: the Dell-OEM cluster degrades gracefully on non-Dell hosts.

boot-source-* (DellBootSources) and raid/storage-convert-* (DellRaidService) are
Dell OEM features with no iLO equivalent — the vendor-neutral paths are the
standard boot-options/change-boot-order and volumes/volume-init commands. These
tests prove the Dell-OEM readers no longer CRASH on an iLO tree: they return a
clear "Dell-specific" result instead of raising. The RAID commands also no longer
hardcode System.Embedded.1 (they use the discovered system id).

Dell behavior (where the OEM resource exists) is covered by the existing dual-mode
tests, which still pass.
