"""Dual-mode test for the storage-drives query command.

Runs offline by default against the mock service (using the iDRAC-shaped Storage
fixture in tests/idrac_fixtures/, which carries a Drives navigation list), and
against real hardware when IDRAC_IP is set. Modeled on test_cmd_boot_dualmode.py.

This is also a regression test for a missing import: cmd_drives.py walks the
Storage payload with find_ids(...) but never imported it, so the offline
'storage-drives' path raised NameError before the import was added. The tests
drive the command through sync_invoke and assert a CommandResult comes back
without a NameError.
