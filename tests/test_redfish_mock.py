"""Offline tests that drive the real Redfish HTTP layer against the captured
DMTF mockup tree (idrac_ctl/json_responses) via the ``redfish_mock`` fixture.

This is the foundation for converting the live (@pytest.mark.live) command tests
to run without hardware: the same code path that talks to a real iDRAC runs here
against static mockup JSON. See IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md item 5.
